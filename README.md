# Heart_disease_prediction

Thus preventing Heart diseases has become more than necessary. Good data-driven systems for predicting heart diseases can improve the entire research and prevention process, making sure that more people can live healthy lives. This is where Machine Learning comes into play. Machine Learning helps in predicting the Heart diseases, and the predictions made are quite accurate.

The project involves analysis of the heart disease patient dataset with proper data processing.  Different models are trained and predictions are made with different algorithms KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest,SVM,Logistic Regression etc.

Variety of Machine Learning algorithms, implemented in Python has been used to predict the presence of heart disease in a patient. This is a classification problem, with input features as a variety of parameters, and the target variable as a binary variable, predicting whether heart disease is present or not.

Machine Learning algorithms used:

Logistic Regression (Scikit-learn)

Naive Bayes (Scikit-learn)

Support Vector Machine (Linear) (Scikit-learn)

K-Nearest Neighbours (Scikit-learn)

Decision Tree (Scikit-learn)

Random Forest (Scikit-learn)

XGBoost (Scikit-learn)

Artificial Neural Network with 1 Hidden layer (Keras)

Accuracy achieved: 95% (Random Forest)
